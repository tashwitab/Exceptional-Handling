Exception handling is a way through which we can manage/handle errors/exceptions. C++ offers keywords such as throw, try, catch to deal with handling exceptions or errors.
The idea is simple you write the code in the try {} block and if there is situation where error rises, you use the throw keyword to raise an exception when an exception is thrown, catch block can be used to deal
with that exception. you can have multiple catch blocks for dealing with different kinds of exceptions. An example would be handling zero division error. although when you try to devide by zero you can get some
output such as inf, but that is not defined behavior It is compiler implemented, so it is a good idea to handle the cases where you divide by zero by using try catch and throw features of C++
